## Overview
Using data obtained via multiple formats (web scraping, CSV and json), we have extracted and transformed movie data in an effort to identify popular movies. We utilized Python to extract the raw data, transform it to remove unnecessary or inaccurate data and sent the final merged dataframe to a SQL database for storage and presentation.
